# Machine Learning Fundamentals

This repository serves as a **structured documentation** of the machine learning foundations and techniques I already work with.  
Rather than a learning log, it is a **curated space** where I organize, implement, and showcase essential ML concepts —  
from core fundamentals to practical algorithm implementations.

---

## Goals of This Repository

- **Consolidate** my understanding of key ML foundations  
- **Demonstrate** clean workflows for data exploration and visualization  
- **Showcase** implementations of widely used machine learning algorithms  

---

## Core Understanding Areas:

- **Data Preprocessing**  
  Handling missing values, feature scaling, encoding, normalization, etc.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
  Visualizing datasets, understanding distributions, identifying correlations.

- **Supervised Learning Algorithms**  
  Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, etc.

## Requirements:
 
`pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the requirements for running the notebooks.
